Rank all cat photos comparatively on Contextual Supportiveness. Evaluate how well the background, environment, and surrounding elements complement and enhance each cat as the primary subject. Assess whether contextual elements provide meaningful visual or informational support through color contrast, tonal balance, or compositional logic, or whether they distract and compete for visual attention. Photos where the context harmonizes with the subject should rank higher than those with distracting or conflicting backgrounds.
